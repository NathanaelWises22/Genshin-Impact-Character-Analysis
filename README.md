# Genshin-Impact-Character-Analysis

The 2,6 update is finally here!!! With Kamisato Ayato joining 48 Playable Character we can gacha, a question arise in the minds of every player. "How strong is Ayato?"
On this occasion i tried to make a simple Exploratory Data Analysis about Genshin Impact character base stats at lvl 90.

This is not a recommendation about which character is the best. Because of the nature of the game with different playstyle,elemental reaction,equipment and team composition etc, greatly affect the character damage output. So, the best character is highly subjective according to the player preference.

Instead I try to make a simple comparison with base stat of ATK & DEF of the characters at level 90, and a few simple features such as Elements, Weapon Type & Nation.

From the data i tried to answer these few questions I had, which is :
  1. Who is the character with highest base ATK? From which Region?
  2. Who is the character with highest base Def?
  3. Who is the character with highest base HP?
  4. How's the comparison between the number of Playable Character per Region?
  5. How's the comparison between the number of Playable Character per Weapon type?
  6. How's the distribution of Vision per region?
